# Project Info

I have created two components Client and Server. In server I set up express and connected mongoDB database . In Client I was able to fetch api from server, and implemented pinpong logic game

# What could I improv?

* Leaderboard 
    Leaderboard  could be improved. Right now I'm getting from useState updated point, and comparing two players and getting with the most higher point player. But for some reason in Server I'm updating my players but it is not updating in Mongodb which is not allowing me to work with leaderboard 

* CSS
    CSS could be improved
